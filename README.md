# CCA Programming & Electronics, Spring 2018

This course repository contains homework assignments, useful guides, and code for "Programming & Electronics" at CCA, Spring 2018.

Also included in this repository is the official [course syllabus](syllabus.pdf).

### Week 1: Wednesday, January 17, 2018

Lecture:
- Introductions
- What is programming?
- Goals & course details

Hands-on activities:
- Human Embodiment of Programmer & Robot
  - Programs generally run line-by-line.
  - Repetition, decision making, and recipes break that up.
- [Solving Puzzles](puzzle-sheets.pdf)

#### Building Blocks of Code

In class, we discussed the four basic building blocks of code: actions & recipes, remembering, making decisions, and repetition. 

[Here are some notes.](building-blocks-programs.md)

[Homework for Week 1](hw/week1.md)


### Week 2: Wednesday, September 13, 2017

In-class:
- Homework review.
- Translating "pseudo-code" into real code with [Rudy](http://rudy.zamfi.net); here are some notes on the [building blocks of code](building-blocks-code.md).

Workshop:

1. Work through the Rudy puzzles with a partner. Make sure you understand the syntax.

2.  **Challenges**: On puzzle 9, the open canvas:
    1.  Draw four rectangles of various sizes on the canvas.
    2.  Define a function, `rect`, that takes four parameters: `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`, and draws a rectangle on the canvas, at location (`x`,`y`) with the corresponding `width` and `height`.
    3.  Modify the `rect` function so that it fills in the rectangle instead of just drawing the outline.
    4.  **Extra Challenge**: Define a `line` function, that takes four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, and draws a line between the point defined by (`x1`,`y1`) and the point defined by (`x2`,`y2`). There are many ways to approach this challenge! You may find some Internet research instructive.
    5.  **Extra Challenge**: Define a `circle` function that takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `r`, and draws a circle of radius `r` centered on the point defined by (`x`,`y`). You find trigonometry helpful for this
